# Training Piscine Python for Data Science - 1: Array

Welcome to the Training Piscine for Data Science, focusing on array manipulation and image processing.

## Key Concepts

- **Array Operations**: Work with arrays, including creation, manipulation, and slicing using libraries like NumPy.
- **Image Processing**: Load, modify, and analyze images using libraries such as Pillow.
- **Visualization**: Utilize Matplotlib for visualizing data and images.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling and validation in your code.
- **Function Implementation**: Develop and test various functions to handle array and image data.

## Additional Rules

- Use Python 3.10 and follow coding norms.
- Encapsulate your code in functions with a `main()` method.
- Ensure all exceptions are handled and functions are well-documented.
- Use explicit imports, for example, `import numpy as np` and `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`.

## Libraries Used

- **NumPy**: For array manipulation and numerical operations.
- **Pillow**: For image loading and processing.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization and plotting.
